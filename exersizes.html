<h1>Discussion Questions</h1>
Week 2
<br>
<ul>
    <li>How would you (the author) recommend explaining web design as a possible artistic canvas not non-artisan civilians who partake in artistic cynicism?</li>
    <li>The "Internet Highway" is a user friendly analogy, however, could a more advanced metaphor be that of the internet compared to traveling space (galaxies, worm holes, black holes, solar systems, etc.)</li>
    <li>ow does Molly separate herself from notable "characters" such as Miranda Sings?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 3
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Look around the "virtual" room.  Many of us are white or light skinned.  It is also likely that a few of us will enter Silicon Valley to pursue future projects and careers.  What can we do in order to confront the "whiteness" of the computer and how can we make this industry more inclusive and diverse?</li>
    <li>When a term such as UX begins to define so many fields and niche topics, does the word lose meaning and relevance?  Is it so general that it is vague?</li>
    <li>When will the "want" or "desire" to build something new not be prioritized over over our social or environmental injustices?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 5
<br>
<ul>
    <li>With one's literal DNA and "online DNA," one could gain the information to make a "face filter" for almost anyone and everyone.  What sort of potential threats could "face filters" created from DNA pose to society?  Has it been shown to the public eye without us knowing?</li>
    <li>What is the difference of being "followed" by a person and be "watched"/"listened" to by Google Home or Alexa?</li>
    <li>dding to the conversation of portable cameras... do we need to fear these forms of surveillance? If we cannot manage to have cops wearing them at all time how realistic is a world wear everyone is wearing them?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 6
<br>
<ul>
    <li>In our current age of society, documentation through the web-space is integral to any revolution.  If people do not see a picture or video of it, then it didn't happen.  How could this fact fall into the wrong hands and be used as a source of propaganda?  Has this ever happened?</li>
    <li>Does technology point out humanity's flaws or highlight its perfection?</li>
    <li>Where does privacy exist within a distributed network?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 7
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Adding to last weeks conversation, is photoshop more dangerous than a camera?  Is photoshop "a gun?"  How do we know what photos are real or altered?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between a "factory" and an artist's studio?</li>
    <li>Should an artist specialize in one or many membranes?  Does being a Jack-of-all-trades make you a master of none?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 8
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Did coders gaze / algorithmic bias emerge from pre-existing racism or a lack of representation in the industry? Or both?</li>
    <li>Adding onto the conversation of data collection, when collecting data, statistics reporters are required to sample "accurate populations" in order to reduce standard error.  Who is checking researchers to make sure they are inclusive of all types of people (race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender pronouns, etc)?  How can these "accurate populations" be upheld when many people within the BIPOC community do not have the accessibility, transportation, or time as a result of institutional racism which prevents them from being represented within these studies?</li>
    <li>How can we make our AI spaces inclusive when it is "white power holders" who control monetization and what appears in your social media feed?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 10
<br>
<ul>
    <li>One of my past theatre professors argued that "art cannot be political."  While I do not agree with her claim, she argued that if an artist became political, they choose a side, and therefore had a skewed lens from which they could tell stories through.  Ultimately, an artists' greatest weakness is their bias, she argued.  What do you think of this claim and how would you respond to it?</li>
    <li>So many young minds rely on getting "likes" in order to fulfill their happiness.  It is hard to predict the future, but if you had to, what will be the next equivalent to "likes" that will plague our minds?</li>
    <li>How can we more effectively honor "the land" of the internet / cyber space?  Does that include, but is not limited to what?</li>
    <li>Who is allowed to tell other peoples' stories?  Is it moral to write a story does that does not reflect your own culture?  Where does the line get drawn?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 11
<br>
<ul>
    <li>There are many ways to make design more emotionally and financially sustainable in our society.  However, there is a lack of coping mechanisms when it comes to the physical/biological factors which can take a large toll on our health.  What are some practices we can incorporate to keep our physical health up to par when we spend most of our times seated in front of our computers?</li>
    <li>What could be a substitute for the word "reform?"</li>
    <li>Many companies have made extreme efforts to diversify their employees, but where do we draw the line between "inclusion" and "tokenism?"  How do we prevent the act of "tokenism?"</li>
</ul>
