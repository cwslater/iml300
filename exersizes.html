Discussion Questions
<br>
Week 2
<br>
<ul>
    <li>How would you (the author) recommend explaining web design as a possible artistic canvas not non-artisan civilians who partake in artistic cynicism?</li>
    <li>The "Internet Highway" is a user friendly analogy, however, could a more advanced metaphor be that of the internet compared to traveling space (galaxies, worm holes, black holes, solar systems, etc.)</li>
    <li>ow does Molly separate herself from notable "characters" such as Miranda Sings?</li>
</ul>

Week 3
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Look around the "virtual" room.  Many of us are white or light skinned.  It is also likely that a few of us will enter Silicon Valley to pursue future projects and careers.  What can we do in order to confront the "whiteness" of the computer and how can we make this industry more inclusive and diverse?</li>
    <li>When a term such as UX begins to define so many fields and niche topics, does the word lose meaning and relevance?  Is it so general that it is vague?</li>
    <li>When will the "want" or "desire" to build something new not be prioritized over over our social or environmental injustices?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Week 5
<br>
<ul>
    <li>With one's literal DNA and "online DNA," one could gain the information to make a "face filter" for almost anyone and everyone.  What sort of potential threats could "face filters" created from DNA pose to society?  Has it been shown to the public eye without us knowing?</li>
    <li>What is the difference of being "followed" by a person and be "watched"/"listened" to by Google Home or Alexa?</li>
    <li>dding to the conversation of portable cameras... do we need to fear these forms of surveillance? If we cannot manage to have cops wearing them at all time how realistic is a world wear everyone is wearing them?</li>
</ul>
