    I was told to water my garden once a day.  It established a wonderful routine.  I woke up, made a cup of coffee, and headed to the garden to get my knees dirty.  I checked up on the plants and began to water.  The plants enjoyed their H2O at first, it was hot after all, but they soon began to yellow.  They started to droop.  They began to wilt.  “They must need more water,” I thought to myself.  This was an example of me over thinking, over caring, and micromanaging.  The water did not help, so I left them alone.  The leaves began to return to their vibrant green and the leaves started to stretch back towards the sun.  This was a lesson in patience.
