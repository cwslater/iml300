    <header>An exciting day is ahead. With my tiny pouch of radish seeds, I scattered them amongst my two garden bins. They started growing at a very fast pace, but as the days went on, they began to slow down. Their leaves began to yellow and holes appeared on the leaves. I was disheartened, but realized there were two issues: baby praying mantises and cut-throat competition. Within my garden, I found a bunch of tiny praying mantises munching on my plants. Pestsâ€¦ I flicked them off with my pointer finger, but the radishes still would not grow. I realized I had, yet again, been overly ambitious. This is one of the biggest lessons I took away from my garden. With so many plants in a bin, they were competing over nutrients: water, soil, and sunlight. The radishes died off, but not my spirit.</header>
