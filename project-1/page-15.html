 	<header>Yes, gardening is time consuming. Yes, it requires a lot of time digging in the dirt. Yes, it can be frustrating at times. That being said, a garden doesn't just grow food. It plants the seeds of a new start, journey, and saga. It forces you to become more mature and find your authentic self. Don't just grow fruit. Grow new meaning in your life. Enjoy your fresh tomatoes!</header>
